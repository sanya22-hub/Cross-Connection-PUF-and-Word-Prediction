# Cross-Connection-PUF & Word-Prediction
CS771 Introduction to ML course project

---
# Problem Statement 1 : Cross-Connection-PUF
** Guess the word from up to 5 sorted, deduplicated bigrams. Given a tuple of ≤5 bigrams (sorted, deduped), return ≤5 word guesses from a dictionary.  
Score = `1 / (#guesses)` if the correct word appears, else `0`. We report average precision**  
Course project inspired by genome assembly (overlapping reads → whole sequence).

# Problem Statement 2 : Word sequencing
** Guess the word from up to 5 sorted, deduplicated bigrams. Given a tuple of ≤5 bigrams (sorted, deduped), return ≤5 word guesses from a dictionary.  
Score = `1 / (#guesses)` if the correct word appears, else `0`. We report average precision**
