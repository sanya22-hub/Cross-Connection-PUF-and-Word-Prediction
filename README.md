## Problem Statement 1: Cross-Connection PUF (COCO-PUF)
**Learn a linear/separable model over a **feature map** of 32-bit PUF challenges to predict **which signal wins** (upper vs lower) for two cross-connected arbiter chains, producing **Response0** and **Response1** bits.**

# Problem Statement 2 : Word sequencing
** Guess the word from up to 5 sorted, deduplicated bigrams. Given a tuple of ≤5 bigrams (sorted, deduped), return ≤5 word guesses from a dictionary.  Score = `1 / (#guesses)` if the correct word appears, else `0`. We report average precision Inspired by genome assembly (overlapping reads → whole sequence).**
